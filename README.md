# üíß Capstone Project: Web/Mobile Tool for Water Supply Network Mapping

## üí° Abstract

This project presents a novel, cost-effective web and mobile tool for mapping and managing water supply networks. Developed in response to the **Jal Jeevan Mission** , the platform addresses a critical gap in affordable, integrated digital solutions for water infrastructure. Current proprietary systems, like ArcGIS, are expensive and lack essential features such as real-time monitoring and grievance redressal. Our solution integrates three key components into one platform: a geospatial database, a real-time IoT alert system, and a user-friendly grievance redressal system. By using open-source technology, this project provides a practical and economically viable solution for proactive water resource management.

## üéØ Objectives

The project's five core objectives are defined to address the specific requirements of the problem statement. The project aims to:

* **Develop a geospatial database:** Create a comprehensive database of all major water supply network structures, including pipelines, pumping stations, and distribution points.
* **Build a web-based mapping tool:** Design and develop a web application for visualizing and managing the water supply network data.
* **Create a mobile application:** Develop a mobile app for field workers to collect and update data on the water supply network in real-time.
* **Implement a grievance redressal system:** Integrate a feature that allows users to report issues and track the status of their complaints.
* **Integrate an IoT alert system:** Incorporate an IoT system for monitoring key parameters (e.g., water pressure, flow rates) and generating real-time alerts for system anomalies.

## üöÄ Innovation and Novel Contributions

Our project's primary contribution is its **integrated, holistic solution**. It goes beyond what generic GIS tools offer by combining geospatial mapping, IoT-based monitoring, and a grievance redressal system into a single platform. A literature review from 2015-2025 confirmed that while these components have been studied separately, their seamless integration into a single, scalable, and affordable tool is a significant innovation.

### Key Contributions:

* **Fragmentation and Lack of Integration:** While GIS tools, IoT monitoring systems, and citizen grievance applications exist as separate entities, a single, integrated platform that combines all three is not widely available in a cost-effective, open-source model.
* **High Cost and Inaccessibility:** Many advanced GIS solutions are proprietary and prohibitively expensive, making them impractical for large-scale public initiatives[cite: 282]. Our project's deliberate choice of open-source software and low-cost hardware addresses this fundamental economic barrier.
* **Proactive vs. Reactive Management:** Traditional systems often operate reactively, responding to issues only after they are reported[cite: 286]. The project's integrated IoT alert system aims to bridge this gap, allowing for early detection of issues and enabling a more efficient, preventative maintenance model.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

The project leverages a modern, open-source technology stack to ensure it is both cost-effective and scalable.

| Component | Technology | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL + PostGIS | Open-source, scalable, and supports complex geospatial data for a unified utility representation. |
| **Web Frontend** | React.js / Angular + Mapbox GL JS / Leaflet | For building dynamic, interactive, and cost-effective web applications for geospatial data visualization. |
| **Mobile Frontend** | React Native / Flutter | To create cross-platform applications from a single codebase, supporting on-site monitoring and updates. |
| **Backend & APIs** | Node.js / Python (Django/Flask) | High-performance server-side frameworks for data processing and APIs. |
| **IoT Protocol** | MQTT | Lightweight and reliable for low-bandwidth, real-time IoT data transmission. |
