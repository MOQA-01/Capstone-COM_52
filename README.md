## ABSTRACT

The Jal Jeevan Mission, India's flagship program to provide piped water to every rural household by 2024, requires robust infrastructure management systems. This project presents a comprehensive, cost-effective platform that integrates geospatial mapping, real-time IoT monitoring, and citizen grievance redressal into a unified solution. The system addresses critical gaps in existing water network management by combining PostgreSQL with PostGIS for spatial data management, MQTT-based IoT sensors for real-time monitoring, and a responsive grievance system for public engagement. 

The platform employs a multi-tiered architecture with sophisticated algorithms including R-tree spatial indexing for efficient geospatial queries, Isolation Forest for initial anomaly detection, and provisions for advanced deep learning models (MCN-LSTM) for predictive maintenance. Built entirely on open-source technologies, the system provides a scalable alternative to expensive proprietary solutions while enabling the transition from reactive to proactive infrastructure management. 

Key outcomes include automated anomaly detection with real-time alerting, comprehensive asset visualization, transparent grievance tracking, and significant cost reduction compared to commercial alternatives. The system successfully demonstrates its capability through simulated IoT data and can process thousands of infrastructure assets efficiently while maintaining sub-second query response times for spatial operations.

# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1 Background of the Problem

India's water crisis affects over 600 million people, with 200,000 deaths annually attributed to inadequate access to safe water. The Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), launched in 2019 by the Ministry of Jal Shakti, represents India's most ambitious water infrastructure initiative, aiming to provide Functional Household Tap Connections (FHTC) to all rural households by 2024. With a budget allocation of ₹3.6 lakh crore, this mission requires sophisticated technological infrastructure for effective implementation and management.

The scale of this undertaking is unprecedented: connecting 190 million rural households across 600,000 villages necessitates the creation of extensive water supply networks comprising millions of kilometers of pipelines, thousands of pumping stations, overhead tanks, and distribution points. Managing such infrastructure requires not just physical construction but also robust digital systems for monitoring, maintenance, and citizen engagement.

Current challenges in water network management include:
- **Fragmented Systems**: Different aspects of water management (mapping, monitoring, complaints) are handled by separate, non-communicating systems
- **Reactive Maintenance**: Problems are addressed only after failures occur, leading to water wastage and service disruptions
- **Limited Visibility**: Lack of real-time data on network health and performance
- **Poor Citizen Engagement**: Inadequate mechanisms for reporting and tracking water-related grievances
- **High Costs**: Proprietary solutions are financially prohibitive for large-scale deployment

## 1.2 Problem Statement

Based on Problem Statement Number **PSCS_95** from the Ministry of Jal Shakti, there is an explicit requirement for developing a "cost-effective technology" that serves as a comprehensive web/mobile tool for water network management. The tool must fulfill three critical functions:

1. **Create and maintain a geospatial database** of water supply network infrastructure
2. **Implement a grievance redressal system** for citizen engagement
3. **Deploy an IoT-based alert monitoring system** for proactive maintenance

The core challenge is the absence of an affordable, integrated platform that unifies these functions into a single, coherent solution suitable for deployment across India's diverse rural landscape.

## 1.3 Statistics and Scale

The magnitude of the Jal Jeevan Mission presents unique technical challenges:

- **Geographic Coverage**: 28 states and 8 Union Territories
- **Target Households**: 190 million rural households
- **Infrastructure Components**:
  - Pipeline Network: Estimated 4+ million kilometers
  - Water Sources: 3.5 million (wells, rivers, reservoirs)
  - Storage Structures: 500,000+ overhead tanks
  - Pumping Stations: 250,000+ installations
- **Daily Water Requirement**: 55 liters per capita per day (lpcd)
- **Investment**: ₹3.6 lakh crore (approximately $48 billion)
- **Timeline**: 2019-2024 (extended based on progress)

As of 2025, approximately 65% of rural households have received tap connections, generating massive amounts of operational data that require sophisticated management systems.

## 1.4 Prior Existing Technologies

### Commercial GIS Solutions
**Esri ArcGIS Water Utility Network Management**
- **Strengths**: Comprehensive features, industry-standard, robust spatial analysis
- **Limitations**: License costs exceed ₹50 lakhs annually for enterprise deployment, steep learning curve, requires specialized training

- **Limitations**: Primarily for data collection and reporting, lacks real-time monitoring and spatial visualization

## 1.5 Proposed Approach

Our solution adopts a **convergence architecture** that strategically combines open-source technologies to create a cost-effective, integrated platform. The approach is characterized by:

1. **Unified Data Model**: Single PostgreSQL database with PostGIS extension serving as the central repository for all spatial, temporal, and operational data
2. **Microservices Architecture**: Modular design allowing independent scaling and updates
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic functionality works offline with enhanced features when connected
4. **Open Standards**: Use of OGC standards for spatial data, MQTT for IoT, REST APIs for integration
