# üíß Capstone Project: Web/Mobile Tool for Water Supply Network Mapping

## üí° Abstract

This project presents a novel, cost-effective web and mobile tool for mapping and managing water supply networks. [cite_start]Developed in direct response to the **Jal Jeevan Mission**, our platform fills a critical gap in affordable, integrated digital solutions for water infrastructure management[cite: 18, 31, 349]. [cite_start]Current proprietary systems, such as ArcGIS, are often expensive and lack essential features like real-time monitoring and an integrated grievance redressal system[cite: 20, 343].

Our solution is an integrated platform that combines three key components:
1.  [cite_start]**A geospatial database** of water infrastructure[cite: 21, 42].
2.  [cite_start]**A real-time IoT alert system** for network issues[cite: 21, 46].
3.  [cite_start]**A user-friendly grievance redressal system**[cite: 21, 45].

[cite_start]By leveraging open-source technology, this project provides a practical and economically viable solution for proactive water resource management[cite: 23, 116].

## üéØ Objectives

The project's five core objectives are:
* [cite_start]**Develop a geospatial database:** Create a comprehensive database of all major water supply network structures, including pipelines, pumping stations, and distribution points[cite: 42, 328].
* [cite_start]**Build a web-based mapping tool:** Design and develop a web application for visualizing and managing water supply network data[cite: 43, 329].
* [cite_start]**Create a mobile application:** Develop a mobile app for field workers to collect and update data on the network in real-time[cite: 44, 330].
* [cite_start]**Implement a grievance redressal system:** Integrate a system that allows users to report issues and track the status of their complaints[cite: 45, 331].
* [cite_start]**Integrate an IoT alert system:** Incorporate an IoT system to monitor key parameters like water pressure and flow rates, generating real-time alerts for anomalies[cite: 46, 332].

## üöÄ Innovation and Novel Contributions

[cite_start]Our project's primary contribution is its **integrated, holistic solution** that addresses significant gaps in the existing technological landscape[cite: 105, 190, 400]. [cite_start]The literature survey from 2015-2025 confirmed that while individual components like GIS, IoT monitoring, and citizen engagement apps have been studied separately, their seamless integration into a single, scalable, and affordable tool is a significant innovation[cite: 22, 57, 108].

### **Key Contributions:**

* [cite_start]**Fragmentation and Lack of Integration:** We are creating a single, integrated platform that combines all three core functions, which is not widely available, especially in a cost-effective, open-source model[cite: 108].
* [cite_start]**High Cost and Inaccessibility:** We are deliberately using open-source software and low-cost hardware to address the high financial barriers of proprietary GIS solutions, making our tool practical for large-scale public initiatives in low-resource settings[cite: 114, 116, 183].
* [cite_start]**Proactive vs. Reactive Management:** The integrated IoT alert system enables a shift from reactive problem-solving to a proactive, predictive maintenance model[cite: 119, 193, 408]. [cite_start]The system allows for the early detection of issues, enabling preventative action[cite: 194].

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

[cite_start]The project utilizes a modern, open-source technology stack to ensure it is cost-effective and scalable[cite: 125, 183].

| Component | Technology | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL + PostGIS | [cite_start]Open-source, scalable, and supports complex geospatial data for unified utility representation[cite: 133]. |
| **Web Frontend** | React.js / Angular + Mapbox GL JS / Leaflet | [cite_start]For building dynamic, interactive, and cost-effective web apps for geospatial data visualization[cite: 133, 366, 367]. |
| **Mobile Frontend** | React Native / Flutter | [cite_start]To create cross-platform apps from a single codebase, supporting on-site monitoring and updates[cite: 133, 368]. |
| **Backend & APIs** | Node.js / Python (Django/Flask) | [cite_start]High-performance server-side frameworks for data processing and APIs[cite: 133, 371]. |
| **IoT Protocol** | MQTT | [cite_start]Lightweight and reliable for low-bandwidth, real-time IoT data transmission[cite: 133, 374]. |
